Love this idea, Terrie — clean, beautiful, and simple for boarders. I’ve dropped a starter site in the canvas with four files: `index.html`, `dashboard.html`, `styles.css`, and `app.js`. It includes:

* A polished landing page (hero + highlights + contact)
* A Boarder Portal page with:

  * Upcoming farrier/vet dates & news (demo data you can replace)
  * Two payment cards:

    * Monthly Board (select horse, plan, month)
    * Other Fees (farrier, vet, blanket repair, etc., with notes)
* Modern, professional CSS (dark, elegant, accessible, responsive)
* Lightweight JS to handle form validation + redirects to your payment provider

### How payments will work

Right now the JS has placeholders for two links:

* `BOARD_PAYMENT_URL`
* `OTHER_FEES_URL`

Create live **Payment Links** (Stripe is easiest) and paste them into `app.js`. If you need variable amounts for “Other Fees,” make that link a donation/variable-price style so the boarder can enter any amount. If you’d prefer PayPal or Square, we can wire those up too.

### What I need from you

* Your preferred **payment processor** (Stripe/PayPal/Square)
* The **facility name** and any brand colors (if you have them)
* Your **hero and gallery photos** (I’ll swap them in and tune the layout)

Want me to:

1. hook up real Stripe links,
2. swap in your photos and name,
3. add a tiny admin page so you can post farrier/vet dates without touching code?

Say the word and I’ll update the canvas accordingly.
