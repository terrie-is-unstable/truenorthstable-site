README — True North Stable Front Page

What this is:
- A professional Bootstrap 5 homepage with clean separation: external CSS only, no <style> blocks or inline styles beyond semantic HTML classes.
- Components: fixed-top navbar, hero carousel (3 slides), three intro cards, detailed Boarding/Facilities/Trainers sections, Gallery grid, Visit CTA with form, Contact, and Footer.

Why it fits the assignment:
- Uses Bootstrap 5 + Font Awesome via CDNs, semantic section comments, and a separate custom CSS file (3+ rules: brand button, captions, cards, icons, gallery, etc.).
- Zero stray CSS in HTML; minimal progressive JS only for the footer year (allowed).

How to swap images (recommended sizes):
- Carousel hero images: 2400×1200 (landscape), JPG, compressed.
- Section images: 1600×1000.
- Gallery: square 1200×1200 or crop-friendly.
Rename files like tns-hero-barn.jpg, tns-stall.jpg and replace the src attributes.

Where to put files:
- Place index.htm and styles.css in the same folder for a simple static site.
- If using as your course submission, zip as lastname-a3.zip together with this README.

Notes:
- Outside trainers: clearly stated; no implication of in-house training.
- Accessibility: alt text on images, ARIA labels on key components, focus-visible defaults via browser/Bootstrap.
